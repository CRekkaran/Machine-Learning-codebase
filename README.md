## Doubts
1. If we normalize features in tabular dataset, should we normalize test set according to train's mean and std or test's. Also, before submitting answers on test set, how to de-normalize the predictions back to original scale?
2. How does Hashing solves the categorical features problem? And how does it automatically takes care of textual features in Vowpal Wabbit?
